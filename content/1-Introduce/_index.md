### ðŸ“˜ Overview Introduction

This project focuses on building a **real-time web application** that supports **chat and video streaming**, developed using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The system emphasizes not only a fast and intuitive user experience but also **scalability**, **automated deployment**, and **robust cloud-based operation** using modern AWS services.

The application is designed following a **Client â€“ Server â€“ Cloud architecture**, where the frontend and backend are developed separately but work seamlessly together via APIs, real-time services (GetStream), cloud databases.
