## Overview

**Postman** is one of the most popular tools for testing APIs. It allows developers to:

- Send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) to the backend server.
- Add headers, body, and tokens to test authentication.
- View API responses directly.
- Save requests into **collections** for reuse.

In this project, Postman is used to:

- Test the functionality of APIs provided by the **Express backend**.

4. The main Postman interface includes:

   - **Method**: select HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
   - **Headers**: add key-value pairs like `Authorization: Bearer [token]`.

5. Create a dedicated **Collection** for your project to store frequently used requests (e.g., `Login`, `Get All Projects`, `Create Task`, ...).
