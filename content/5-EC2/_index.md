## Overview

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is AWSâ€™s virtual server service that allows you to run applications flexibly and on demand. In this project, EC2 is used to deploy the backend application.

The main steps include:

- **Launching an EC2 instance**: Select an operating system, configure hardware specs, create a key pair, and attach the instance to the appropriate VPC network.

- **Connecting and setting up the environment**: SSH into the instance, install Node.js, Git, and required libraries to run a Node.js backend.

- **Managing processes with PM2**: Run the server in the background and enable automatic restart upon system reboot.
